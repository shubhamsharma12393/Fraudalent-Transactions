This dataset is presently only one of four on Kaggle with information on the rising risk of digital financial fraud, emphasizing the difficulty in obtaining such data. The main technical challenge it poses to predicting fraud is the highly imbalanced distribution between positive and negative classes in 6 million rows of data. Another stumbling block to the utility of this data stems from the possible discrepancies in its description [1], [2], [3]. The goal of this analysis is to solve both these issues by a detailed data exploration and cleaning followed by choosing a suitable machine-learning algorithm to deal with the skew. I show that an optimal solution based on feature-engineering and extreme gradient-boosted decision trees yields an enhanced predictive power of 0.997, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve. Crucially, these results were obtained without artificial balancing of the data making this approach suitable to real-world applications.

Update: This notebook got the Kaggle kernel award for the first week of October 2017.
